CA-NS4,FALSE,NA,1,1,IGBP,"The UCI-1964 wet site is located in a continental boreal forest, dominated by black spruce trees, within the BOREAS northern study area in central Manitoba, Canada. The site is a member of a chronological series of sites that are representative secondary succession growth stages after large stand replacement fires.

CA-TPD,NA,NA,4,1,IGBP,"CA-TPD is a 90-year old managed deciduous (Carolinian Species) forest of the Turkey Point Flux Station. Meteorological and flux data collection was started on 5 January 2012. The data set documented here includes carbon, water and energy fluxes and meteorological and soil measurements. 
\n
\nA unique aspect of Turkey Point Flux Station is its geographic location between the boreal and the broadleaf deciduous forest transition zone. It provides an excellent opportunity to investigate and quantify the strength of the carbon sink or source for planted temperate conifer forests, and its sensitivity to seasonal and annual climate variability. 
\n
\nThe forest is naturally regenerated on sandy terrain and abandoned agricultural land. Predominantly hardwood species with a few scattered conifers. Site has been managed (thinned) in the past. It has a high biodiversity with 573 tree and plant species, 102 bird species, 23 mamal species and 22 reptile and amphibian species (SWALSREP Report, 1999).  The dominant tree species is white oak (Quercus alba), with other scattered broadleaf Carolinian species including sugar and red maple (Acer saccharum, A. rubrum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black and red oak (Q. velutina, Q. rubra) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) . There are also scattered conifers, mostly white and red pine (Pinus strobes, P. resinosa), comprising about 5% of the trees. Average tree height is 25.7m with a stand density of 504 _çç 18 trees per hectare. Average tree diameter at breast height is 22.3 cm and basal area is 0.06 m2 or approximately 29 square meters per hectare.","Active, core measurements presently being made","Ontario, Canada",Ontario - Turkey Point Mature Deciduous,42.6353,-80.5577,260,DBF,Deciduous Broadleaf Forests,NA,35.4,NA,NA,,,,,,"Chu, H., Baldocchi, D.

The site is characterized as Local Climate Zone 11 'low plant cover'. Instruments used in this study to measure radiative and turbulent fluxes were sited on a tripod system (CM-115, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA), 1.5 and 1.8 m above the local ground surface. The site was colonized by a diverse set of tall grasses that ranged in average stand height between 0.5 m (winter) and a maximum of 175 m (August 2009). Heights of most instruments were adjusted in summer to account for the growing grass height. There were no trees or shrubs within 130 m radius of the tripod, and the site fulfills are requirement for micrometeorological flux measurements (flat, extensive fetch). The site was located close to the shoreline (Strait of Geogria) in the Delta of the Fraser River. The area is dominated by intensive farming, but the landuse in the source area of the tower was unmanaged and non-irrigated.","Inactive, core measurements no longer being made","British Columbia, Canada",Westham Island,49.0863,-123.1768,1,CSH,Closed Shrublands,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,

JP-YMS,NA,NA,NA,,,"Yamashiro forest hydrology research site is located in the southern part of Kyoto prefecture. The site is in a broadleaf forest which is built up on weathered granite and the forest is also one of headstreams of Kizu River. The region used to be cleared off as it was managed as a suburban forest, until a century ago, when the green development operated by Johannis de Rijke has brought vegetation restoration. After the invasion by pine wilt disease in 1980____s, Konara oak has taken over and the forest is now regenerated. Such secondary forests are widely distributed throughout Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe and Seto Inland Sea coast area. Yamashiro research site was established to study internal mechanism of carbon circulation and to develop the flux observation method in such ecosystem. This site can be characterized by twin towers (one on the ridge and the other in the valley) to observe space variation in complex terrain. Several cooperative projects are carried out with neighboring universities to quantify the amount of fixed carbon and to find out the mechanism of carbon cycle. Our research activity covers wide range of areas which include long term continuous observation of seasonal change using automated chambers and REA observation of trace gas flux as well as common ecological investigations. Some studies are focusing particularly on high respiration activity of root and litter, and some are concentrating on the loss of noctornal flux by drainage flow or horizontal advection.","Active, core measurements presently being made",Japan,Yamashiro Forest Hydrology Research Site,34.7948,135.8462,187,MF,Mixed Forests,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,

US-Ced,NA,NA,1,1,IGBP,"The Cedar Bridge site is located in the upland forests of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the  largest continuous forested landscape on the Northeastern coastal plain. Upland forests  occupy 62% of the 1.1 million acre Pine Barrens and can be divided into three dominant stand  types, Oak/Pine (19.1%), Pine/Oak (13.1%), and Pitch Pine/Scrub oak (14.3%). The majority of  mature upland forests are the product of regeneration following late 19th century logging  and charcoaling activities. Among the regenerated stands of the same age, tree structure and  aboveground biomass are greatest in the oak-dominated stand (Silas Little) and least in the  Pitch Pine/Scrub oak stand (Cedar Bridge). Fire activity is a common occurrence in the NJ  Pine Barrens, especially in the Pitch Pine/Scrub Oak stand. Prior to a 1995 nonstand  replacing wildfire, the stand was last burned in 1963. Plow lines were installed for fire  control in December of 2007 followed by a prescribed burn in 2008 by the New Jersey Forest  Fire Service. Gypsy moths first appeared in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey in 1966. Since  the time of arrival, the upland forest stands have undergone several episodes of  defoliation, the most significant occurred in 1972, 1981, and 1990. In recent years, the  upland forest region underwent the heaviest defoliation in 2007. Unlike oak-dominated  stands, Pitch Pines are largely unaffected by defoliation and the deciduous understory only  underwent moderate defoliation.

Occupying 310 ha of local forest, the slash pine flatwoods ecosystem is managed as an uneven-aged stand with a sparsely populated overstory and a dense oak-dominated understory. Disturbances tend to occur on a 7 to 10 year cycle, mostly related to Hurricane activity. Prescribed fires have been conducted since 1969 to control understory fuel. The most recent burn was conducted in February of 1995. Following the burn, the stand was allowed to naturally regenerate into a open canopy of slash pines, less than 15% of canopy coverage, with a understory mostly composed of saw palmetto scrub. A severe drought gripped most of Florida beginning in 1998 until the later half of 2001 resulting in four years of relatively low annual precipitation totals. Exceptionally high annual rainfall amounts in 2004 and 2005 were the result of a pair of hurricanes that hit the area in September of 2004 and October of 2005.

US-Me4,FALSE,NA,1,1,IGBP,"The Metolius Old Pine site, located in central Oregon, is part of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research and Regional Analysis Project (TERRA-PNW). The tower is located within the Metolius Research Natural Area designated by the USFS. Extending at least 12 km in all directions, the surrounding forest consists of even-aged stands of old growth trees, young trees, and mixed aged stands. The eddy-flux tower footprint was classified as ~48% mixed age, ~27% old growth, and ~25% young aged stands. Considering that the forest has never been logged, the ~259 year history of fire disturbances is directly linked to the three classes of stand ages. First, the old-growth component has remain unchanged since a 1748 fire that caused a 100% stand replacement. In 1854, a second fire resulted in a 50% stand replacement. Finally, the youngest trees (~54 years) in the region are the result of a 50% replacement fire in 1944. Due to this local stand variation, qualitative descriptions of biological processes at the old pine site are typically divided into mixed-age and old growth components. This botanical partitioning is adhered to throughout the majority of the information provided below.

US-Oho,NA,NA,4,1,IGBP,"The Ohio Oak Openings site is located within the Oak Openings Preserve Metropark of northwest Ohio, one of the few remaining oak woodlands/savanna/prairie complexes in the Midwest. Declared one of the ""One of America's Last Great Places"" by the Nature Conservancy, the area consists of four main vegetation types: Oak Woodlands, Oak Savanna, Floodplain Forests, and Wet Prairies. The stand surrounding the tower is mainly Oak Woodlands, dominated by red, white, and black oaks, with a relatively abundant population of red maples indicating high soil moisture retention and a history of limited fire disturbances. Most of the area was cleared for agriculture at the time of Euro-American settlements in the mid to late-19th century. A large fraction of the cleared land was later abandoned due to the poor sandy soils. These areas reverted to Oak Savannas and in cases where fire was limited, progressively made the transition to Oak Woodlands. Today, patches of the forest are burned every few years as part of prescribed burning cycle to control stand density. During the first two years of active data collection, 2005 was warmer and dryer than 2004, with a pronounced drought period during the annual period of canopy development.

Geomorphological features in the surrounding terrain are principally the result of glacial activity. More specifically, small elevation changes, on the order of 20 m, create a mixed landscape of wetlands and upland forests. Logging activities include thinning and clear-cuts, and are concentrated in the upland regions. The fraction of forests, within the tower footprint, cut in a given year is small, but a significant fraction of the landscape has experienced some cutting or thinning within the past few decades. The whole region was heavily logged around the beginning of the 20th century, similar to many forests in the north central United States. Park Falls is a member of the Chequamegon Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study, which also includes the Willow Creek, Lost Creek, and Sylvania Wilderness sites.

At that time the landscape was an upland dry prairie consisting mainly of C4 and C3 plants. The harvesting of wheat (C3) began in 1879. Shortly before the study began (1998-2001) corn was consistently planted annually. In 2002, agriculture changed to an annual rotation of soybean-corn. Beginning in November of 2003, the Rosemount G21 site is located within a soybean-corn annual rotation field, characteristic of Upper Midwest agriculture. A significant feature of the G21 site is the TDL system used to study isotopic fluxes of carbon in carbon dioxide. These isotopic measurements are integrated with traditional eddy covariance measurements in an effort to improve understanding of not only carbon exchange in agricultural landscapes, but also the spatial and temporal relationships between carbon fluxes and isotopic discrimination of carbon 13. Further information can be found in Griffis et al.

Upland forests occupy 62% of the 1.1 million acre Pine Barrens and can be divided into three  dominant stand types, Oak/Pine (19.1%), Pine/Oak (13.1%), and Pitch Pine/Scrub oak (14.3%).  The majority of mature upland forests are the product of regeneration following late 19th  century logging and charcoaling activities. Among the regenerated stands of the same age,  tree structure and aboveground biomass are least in the Pitch Pine/Scrub oak stand (Cedar  Bridge) and greatest in the oak-dominated Oak/Pine stand (Silas Little). Gypsy moths first  appeared in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey in 1966. Since the time of arrival, the upland  forest stands have undergone several episodes of defoliation, the most significant occurred  in 1972, 1981, and 1990. In 2007, the Silas Little Oak/Pine stand, was completely defoliated  from the end of May until mid-July, defined by a greater than or equal to 75% reduction in  canopy foliage.

US-UMd,FALSE,NA,4,1,IGBP,"The UMBS Disturbance site is an artificial disturbance site that has recently been created as part of the Forest Accelerate Succession ExperimenT (FASET). In Spring 2008, every aspen and birch tree (>6,700, ~35% canopy LAI), the dominant early successional trees, were girdled over 39 ha of the FASET treatment plot to stimulate a disturbance that will move the forest into a later successional stage, dominated by maples, oaks, and white pine. This treatment caused aspen and birch mortality within 2 - 3 years. As a result of the changed canopy structure, there is a divergence in net ecosystem exchange between the control plot (enhanced carbon uptake) and the treatment plot (reduced carbon uptake).","Active, core measurements presently being made",United States,UMBS Disturbance,45.5625,-84.6975,239,DBF,Deciduous Broadleaf Forests,1,NA,34,20,,,,,,"Atkins, J.
